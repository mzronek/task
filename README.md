# Chat Bot

Implement a chat bot as a web application using the [flow.json](flow.json) file as input data. You can put more or less effort into certain features to show your interests and strengths. Some features can be rudimentary, but every feature should be implemented in the end.

## Features

- [x] Load the [chat bot data](flow.json) asynchronously or via SSR
- [x] The chat bot flow starts with question id 100
- [x] Use the chosen option‘s nextId to guide the user through the dynamic flow
- [x] All previously entered answers need to be displayed
- [x] If the nextId is false, the flow is terminated and the following message is shown: „Herzlichen Dank für Ihre Angaben“
- [x] Finally the answers are sent combined as a PUT request to [this endpoint](https://virtserver.swaggerhub.com/L8475/task/1.0.1/conversation) (see [OpenAPI specification](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/L8475/task/1.0.1) for details)
